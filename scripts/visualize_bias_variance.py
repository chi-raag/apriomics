"""
Visualize the Bias-Variance Trade-off from Existing Benchmark Results.

This script loads the detailed CSV output from the main benchmark run
and calculates the bias and variance for each estimation method.

Methodology:
1.  Loads the detailed results from 'output/benchmark_prior_recovery_results.csv'.
    This file should contain the estimated beta for each metabolite for each
    replicate and method.
2.  Calculates the ground truth lnFC values for all metabolites.
3.  For each method and at a specific sample size (e.g., n=10 per group):
    a. It merges the estimated betas with the ground truth betas.
    b. It calculates the error for each estimate: error = beta_estimate - beta_true.
    c. It computes the Bias^2 (the squared mean of the errors) and the
       Variance (the variance of the errors).
4.  It generates a scatter plot of Variance (x-axis) vs. Bias^2 (y-axis),
    which provides a clear comparison of the trade-offs made by each model.
